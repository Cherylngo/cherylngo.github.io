## Capstone Project
### An Analysis of The St. James' Revenue and Marketing Data

Description: The St. James is a boutique health club in Northern Virginia.  The goal of this project was for student groups to provide the business with insight into their membership base, marketing efficacy, venue usage, and future location sites.  This was provided through descriptive analysis of their member venue check-in patterns, member driving distances, and revenue distribution as well as modeling of the number of members joined and projected trends in sports participation for their future locations.
